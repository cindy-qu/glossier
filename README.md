# About Glossier Fanatics
I have been a long time fan of Glossier and I often frequent the Glossier subreddit to stay up to date on newest product releases. I created this site to help other Glossier fans search for past products! You can search past products and add items to your wishlist or collection.

This application was created using a React.js frontend and Ruby on Rails API backend. This app utilizes Active Storage from Ruby on Rails and is connected to an AWS s3 account for managing image file storage. 

If you choose to fork and clone this project, run the React.js front-end with 'npm start --prefix client', and the Ruby on Rails API backend with: 'rails s'.
