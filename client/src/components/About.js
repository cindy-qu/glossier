        Hi, my name is Cindy. I have been a long time fan of Glossier. I often frequent the Glossier subreddit to stay up to date on newest product releases. I created this site to help other Glossier fans search for past products!

        This site is a small side project that is modeled after the very popular site <a className="underline text-red-200 hover:text-red-300 visited:text-red-400" href="https://www.lulufanatics.com/">lulu fanatics</a>. This website is definitely a work in progress. Please feel free to contact me to provide feedback or missing products!
